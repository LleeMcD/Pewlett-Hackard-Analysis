# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis - DRAFT
## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large tech company that employs several thousand people. Many of it's employees are baby-boomers, who are at or near retirment age. The purpose of this analysis is to assist Pewlett-Hackardâ€™s management team with the determination of how many positions and role types will be left vacant in the wake of the "Silver Tsunami".
The analysis was focused on the following:
- The number of employees retiring over the next few years based on age and title.
- The number of positions that will need to be filled.
- The number of employees eligible for a mentorship program that would provide training to fill positions left open by those retiring.
- The number of remaining positions that will need to be filled by other means, e.g., eliminated, combined with other roles or filled by external candidates.
## Results
The analysis findings were as follows:
-	There are 90,398 employees who were born between 1952 and 1955, who are eligible for retirement. A breakdown of employees by title is as follows:  
  - Senior Engineer 29,414

  - Engineer 14,222
  - Staff 12,243
  - Technique Leader 4,502

  - Staff 438
  - Technique Leader 77
