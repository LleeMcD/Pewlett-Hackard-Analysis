# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis 
## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large tech company that employs several thousand people. Many of it's employees are baby-boomers, who are at or near retirment age. The purpose of this analysis is to assist Pewlett-Hackardâ€™s management team with the determination of how many positions will be left vacant in the wake of the "Silver Tsunami" and how to address the associated knowlege drain.
The analysis was focused on the following:
- The number of employees retiring over the next few years based on age and title.
- The number of positions that will need to be filled.
- The number of employees eligible for a mentorship program.
- The number of remaining positions that may need to be filled by other means, e.g., combined with other roles, filled by external candidates or eliminated.
## Results
The analysis findings were as follows:
-	There are 90,398 employees who were born between 1952 and 1955, who are eligible for retirement. A breakdown of employees by title is as follows:  
  - Senior Engineer 29,414
  - Senior Staff 28,254
  - Engineer 14,222
  - Staff 12,243
  - Technique Leader 4,502
  - Assistant Engineer 1,761
  - Manager 2

There are currently 1,549 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. These individuals will train new employees to fill the soon to be vacant positions. The breakdown of positions for these employees is as follows:
  - Senior Engineer 419
  - Senior Staff 286
  - Engineer 289
  - Staff 438
  - Technique Leader 77
  - Assistant Engineer 43
  - Manager 0

## Summary and Recommendations
The majority of soon to be vacated positions are filled by highly skilled and experienced individuals. It could be challenging to find qualified candidates to replace them. Because of this, Pewlett-Hackard created a mentorship program. 
Qualifying criteria for the mentorship program are:
- Current employee
- Birth year 1965. 
The expectation is that the mentors are more knowledgeable and experienced, so they will be qualified to train new employees to fill the open positions as people retire. With over 90 thousand people retiring, this could pose a challenge. Recommendations based on the findings of the analysis are as follows:
- Use Six Sigma Lean practices to streamline business processes and eliminate roles that do not support forward momentum.
- Consider expanding the mentorship program to include younger, more experienced employees who clearly demonstrate necessary skills and aptitude.
- Use the mentorship program as a catalyst for creating a mentoring culture overall.
- Provide incentive to delay retirement for productive baby-boomers.
- Offer consultant positions to selected retirees to help mitigate the knowledge drain as employees retire.
