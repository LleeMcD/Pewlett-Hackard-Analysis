# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis 
## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large tech company that employs several thousand people. Many of it's employees are baby-boomers, who are at or near retirment age. The purpose of this analysis is to assist Pewlett-Hackardâ€™s management team with the determination of how many positions will be left vacant in the wake of the "Silver Tsunami" and how to address the associated knowlege drain.
The analysis was focused on the following:
- The number of employees retiring over the next few years based on age and title.
- The number of positions that will need to be filled.
- The number of employees eligible for a mentorship program.
- The number of remaining positions that may need to be filled by other means, e.g., combined with other roles, filled by external candidates or eliminated.
## Results
The analysis findings were as follows:
1. There are 90,398 employees who were born between 1952 and 1955, who are eligible for retirement. 
2. 80% of the retiring employees are in highly skilled positions.
3. 64% of retiring employees are in senior positions. A breakdown of retiring employees by title is as follows:  
  - Senior Engineer - 29,414
  - Senior Staff - 28,254
  - Engineer - 14,222
  - Staff - 12,243
  - Technique Leader - 4,502
  - Assistant Engineer - 1,761
  - Manager - 2

4. The Sales and Development teams stand to lose 18,928 employees due to retirement.
- Development 11,627
- Sales 7,301

5. There are currently 1,549 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. These individuals will train new employees to fill the vacant positions. The breakdown of positions for these employees is as follows:
  - Senior Engineer - 419
  - Senior Staff - 286
  - Engineer - 289
  - Staff - 438
  - Technique Leader - 77
  - Assistant Engineer - 43
  - Manager - 0

## Summary and Recommendations
The majority of soon to be vacated positions are filled by highly skilled and experienced individuals. It could be challenging to find qualified candidates to replace them. Because of this, Pewlett-Hackard created a mentorship program. The expectation is that the mentors are more knowledgeable and experienced, so they will be qualified to train new employees to fill the open positions as people retire. The mentorship of employees who will be filling Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineer positions could be challenging due to the number of postions that will need to be filled. 

One recommendation based on the findings would be to consider expanding the mentorship program to include more experienced employees who clearly demonstrate necessary skills and aptitude. The criteria for the mentorship program is having a birthdate in the year 1965 and a qualifying title. The data demonstrates that there is a large pool of potential candidates born in 1961 or after who could provide mentoring to new employees. Some of these employees may be nearing retirement but could be a valuable resorce for the mentorship program.  
- The breakdown of current employees who were born in the year 1961 or after, that are not retiring are listed below:
  - Senior Engineer - 16,299
  - Senior Staff - 16,948
  - Engineer - 19,116
  - Staff - 16,840
  - Technique Leader - 3,672
  - Assistant Engineer - 2,440
  - Manager - 4

Other recommendations are as follows: 
- Use the mentorship program as a catalyst for creating a mentoring culture overall.
- Provide incentive to delay retirement for productive baby-boomers.
- Offer consultant positions to selected retirees to help mitigate the knowledge drain as employees retire.
- Use Six Sigma Lean practices to streamline business processes and eliminate roles that do not support forward momentum.
- Make Pewlett-Hackard the place that people want to work by doing such things as:
  - Promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion.
  - Offering flexible work schedules and job sharing options. 
  - Allowing employees to work remotely full time.
