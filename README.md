# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis - DRAFT
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to assist Pewlett-Hackardâ€™s management team with determining:
- The number of employees retiring over the next few years based on age and title.
- The number of positions that will need to be filled.
- The number of employees eligible for a mentorship program that would provide training to fill positions left open by those retiring.
- The number of remaining positions that will need to be filled by other means, e.g., eliminated, combined with other roles or filled by external candidates.
